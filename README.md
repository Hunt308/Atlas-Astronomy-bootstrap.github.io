First time using bootstrap to create a website and I like it and it could be used to make simple websites and the responsivness on the small phones is good.
I also like the way that margins and paddings and colors and expanding the navbar works. I like you could make text center and uppercase very easily and change the color
Bootstrap is useful and I am glad to learn it and hopefully it will be great assistance for me in the future
